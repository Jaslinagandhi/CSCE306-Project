# CSCE306-Project
Hi Professor Aldawud, 

This portfolio contains the final conclusion for our computer networking project. All files will require the iostream class to be imported since the string type will be used along with other iostream attributes such as "to_string" and "cout". Also, in the main class, fstream, sstream, tuple, and queue will also need to be included. The first three are used for importing the get request and reading it to get the required information. Then the queue is imported because it will be used as a buffer once the layers are being imported. Also, since all layers are coded on seperate header files, each header file will need to be included. Next, after each layer is imported, each layer is intialized with the correct parameters then passed to the next layer from the queue. 

This will help with reusability since the queue will pop off the most recent thing passed to it which doesn't have to be hard coded.

Each header file contains all attributes with set and get methods for each, then there is a "toString" method that prints out all the values of the attributes.

Thank you for hiring us for this very important project. It was a pleasure to work with you.

Sincerly,
Jaslina Gandhi and Olivia Wegner
